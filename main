cul sum （前提是必须要2个colums, order by & subsum）

        SET @csum := 0;
        SELECT 日期, 净利润, (@csum := @csum + 净利润) AS 累计利润
        FROM daily_pnl_view;

        sum(games_played) OVER(partition by player_id order by event_date)  


生成连续数列 （1，2，3）
        Select row_number() OVER (Order by c1)  From 
        (Select (IF (id is not null,1,0 )) as c1
        From tree) tb1

找到连续的符合要求的值： 重点， distinct, OR
        Select Distinct t1.id, t1.visit_date, t1.people
        From Stadium t1, Stadium t2, Stadium t3
        Where (t1.people >= 100 AND t2.people >=100 AND t3.people >= 100)
        AND ( (t1.id + 1 = t2.id AND t2.id + 1 = t3.id) OR (t1.id = t2.id + 1 AND t1.id + 1 = t3.id) OR 
        (t1.id = t2.id + 2 AND t1.id = t3.id + 1) )
        Order by  t1.id
        
        
        
        
Union    union 之间没有把select .. 命名
      With tb as 

      (select id, 'ROOT' as Type from tree
      where p_id is null
      union
      select id,'Leaf' as Type from tree
      where id not in (select p_id from tree where p_id is not null)
      union
      select id, 'Inner' as Type from tree
      where id in (select p_id from tree where p_id is not null)
      and p_id is not null)
